A demo program to read configuration file and strip all comment strings satrted
with a '#' (or other char).

Thie program is written to make a JSON file support comment. We can do some
preprocess to convert the JSON(with comments) into standard JSON.

It can be improved to support bash script or C/C++ source file.
